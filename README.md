Functional Requirement: I was unable to search for a course using its course code and realized we had to search the course with its name instead. Most people wouldn't do that so this feature should to be added.

Non-functional Requirement: Have to improve the UI of the application as the information is hard to read and interpret. For example the output of searching a course is a table with just text and the table doesn't have any sort of distinguishable lines that separate the information.
